## Problems

### I had some problems with the connection on socket.io, wich worked in the first place, but couldnt really find out what went wrong, i threw away too much time on this + trying to get some help through a react community on discord called "Reactiflux". This problem made the message site didnt work which was sad, but not much i could do with the small amount of time we had on this exam.

### Another problem is that i focused on this connection way to long so i didnt get to write too many tests. But if i had more time i would write both ProfilPage.test and ErrorView.test green and maybe fully test the profile properly since its barely testing anything now.

### I didnt focus too much on the css, just wanted a header so i made it for going back and forth of the sites easier, but the colors i can already apologize for, hehe.

## What would i do next?

### I Would try to use websockets as we did in a lecture, and not Socket.io as i dont have any experience with it (cant admit i have much experience with ws either..)

### I used some extra time figuring out the exam aswell, didnt quite understand what you guys wanted us to implement, so i hope im on the right path.

### I would also make a register site where a user got taken to right away when he opened the application, so he either needs to make one account or log in if he already have an account.
